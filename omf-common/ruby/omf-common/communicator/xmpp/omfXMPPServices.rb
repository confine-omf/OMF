# == Description
#
# This file implements 
#
# a Publish/Subscribe Service Helper.
# This PubSub Service Helper is based on XMPP.
# This current implementation uses the library XMPP4R.

# This class subclasses 'Jabber::PubSub::ServiceHelper' because its 
# 'unsubscribe_from' method is broken. 
# Indeed, as stated in the XMPP4R v0.4 API, it does NOT support the 'subid' 
# field. However, the OpenFire v3.6 server (which we currently use as XMPP 
# Server) requires the use of that field to process unsubsribe requests, 
# otherwise it replies with a 'Bad request' error.
# This class also implements a 'ping' back to the XMPP server, as defined
# in http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0199.html#c2s

# This class defines a XMPP Service Helper for OMF entities.
# Following the PubSub communication paradigm, this class will be the
# 'XMPP Client' which will talk to an 'XMPP Server'. So far, we have tested
# this class with OpenFire (v3.6) and EJabberd XMPP servers.
# This Service Helper will handle all messages to and from the XMPP Server.
# Following the XMPP4R scheme, this class holds a single connection to a
# main (or 'home') XMPP server, and potentially several 'service helpers'
# which are used to access other XMPP servers via 'home' server and the 
# XMPP Server2Server capability.
