# == Description
#
# The OMF::Services module provides an API into the available services
# and methods.  For instance, to call the 'allOffSoft' method on the
# 'cmc' service, the folowing ruby statement will look up the appropriate
# function to call and supply its arguments in the correct format:
#
#  OMF::Services.cmc.allOffSoft(...)
#
# The OMF::Services module takes care of the lookup process.  If it
#
# This architecture relies on the fact that all AM's must be
# self-describing

    #
    # Set up the domains that the service call architecture uses to make
    # calls to the Aggregate Manager services.  There can be multiple
    # AM's listening on different domains, including both HTTP and XMPP
    # domains.
    #
    # The +opts+ hash describes what
    # domains to use.  If there is an XMPP communicator configured, we
    # add that as the first domain to use when requesting a particular
    # service.  We then add the domains found in OConfig[:ec_config][:services]
    #
    # For XMPP communicator domain, we grab the required information
    # directly from the OConfig[:ec_config][:communicator] item.  For
    # the rest, each item under OConfig[:ec_config][:services] must be a
    # hash containing a :type field, either :xmpp or :http, and a :uri
    # field specifying the location of the AM.  For instance, for an
    # XMPP AM and an HTTP AM, the YAML file might look like:
    #
    # :aggmgr:
    #       :services:
    #         -
    #           :type :xmpp
    #           :uri  'norbit.npc.nicta.com.au'

    #           :user: "aggmgr"
    #           :password: "123"
